# Radix Angular


> Radix-NG is an unofficial Angular port of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), thus we share the same principal and vision when building primitives.

Radix Primitives is a low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience. You can use these components either as the base layer of your design system, or adopt them incrementally.
