## Preface

The component depends on the [@internationalized/date package](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/index.html),
which solves a lot of the problems that come with working with dates and times in JavaScript.

We highly recommend reading through the documentation for the package to get a solid feel
for how it works, and you'll need to install it in your project to use the date-related components.

## Installation

Install the date package.

```bash
npm install @internationalized/date
```

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ng/primitives
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```html
<div rdxTimeFieldRoot>
    <div rdxTimeFieldInput></div>
    <input rdxVisuallyHiddenInput />
</div>
```
