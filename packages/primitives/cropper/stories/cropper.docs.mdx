# Cropper

#### Headless component for interactive image cropping — inspired by the experience on [X](https://x.com/)

Based on React version [image-cropper](https://github.com/origin-space/image-cropper)

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={Stories.Default} />

## Features

- ✅ Interactive: Supports zooming (mouse wheel, pinch gesture) and panning (mouse drag, touch drag, arrow keys).
- ✅ Aspect Ratio: Enforces a specified aspect ratio for the crop area.
- ✅ Controlled/Uncontrolled: Manage zoom state internally or control it via props.
- ✅ Crop Calculation: Outputs precise pixel coordinates of the cropped area relative to the original image.
- ✅ Accessible: Designed with ARIA attributes and requires a description element for screen reader users.
- ✅ Customizable: Control zoom limits, sensitivity, padding, keyboard steps, and apply custom styles.
