# Getting started

<Description>Install Radix Themes and start building in minutes.</Description>

Radix Themes is a pre-styled component library that is designed to work out of the box with minimal configuration.
If you are looking for the unstyled components, go to [Radix Primitives](/primitives/overview/introduction).

## Installation

Getting up and running is quick and easy.

### 1. Install Radix Themes

Install the package from your command line.
```shell
npm install @radix-ui/themes
```

### 2. Import the CSS file

Import the global CSS file at the root of your application.

```css
@import '@radix-ui/themes/styles.css';
```

For `NX` added to `build.options`
```json
{
    "styles": [
        "@radix-ui/themes/styles.css"
    ],
    "stylePreprocessorOptions": {
        "includePaths": [
            "node_modules/"
        ]
    }
}
```


### 3. Add the Theme component

Add `Theme` (RdxThemeDirective) to your application, wrapping the root component inside of `body`.

```typescript {4, 9, 11-13, 16}
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import 'zone.js';
import { RdxThemeDirective } from '@radix-ng/components/theme';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [RdxThemeDirective],
  template: `
    <div rdxTheme data-accent-color="indigo"
                  data-radius="medium"
                  data-scaling="100%">
        <h1>Hello from {{ name }}!</h1>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://angular.dev/overview">Learn more about Angular</a>
    </div>
  `
})
export class App {
  name = 'Angular';
}

bootstrapApplication(App);
```

## Customizing your theme

Configuration is managed and applied via the [Theme]() component.
