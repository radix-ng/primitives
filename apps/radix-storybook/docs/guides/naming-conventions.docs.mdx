# Naming Conventions for Directives

This document outlines the naming conventions for Angular directives within the Radix project.
Consistent naming conventions help maintain code readability, improve collaboration, and ensure that all developers understand the purpose and scope of each directive.

## Prefix for Directives

All custom directives in the Radix project must use the prefix `rdx`.
This prefix helps distinguish Radix directives from native Angular directives and those from third-party libraries.

## Naming Format

The general format for naming a directive is as follows:

```html
<rdxDirectiveName></rdxDirectiveName>
```

Where:

- `rdx` is the prefix for Radix directives.
- `directiveName` is a descriptive name in camelCase that indicates the purpose or functionality of the directive.

## Guidelines

1. Descriptive Names: Choose a name that clearly describes the directiveâ€™s functionality. Avoid abbreviations that are not universally understood.
2. camelCase: Use camelCase for the directive class name and the selector. The prefix rdx is lowercase, and the directive name starts with a lowercase letter.
3. Avoid Conflicts: Ensure that the directive name does not conflict with any existing native Angular directives or third-party library directives.
4. Documentation: Provide clear documentation and examples for each directive in the codebase to help other developers understand its usage.

By adhering to these naming conventions and guidelines, we can maintain a clean, organized, and understandable codebase for this project.

## Examples

1. **Highlight Directive**: This directive adds a highlight color to an element.

- Directive Class Name: `RdxHighlightDirective`
- Selector: `[rdxHighlight]`

```html
<p rdxHighlight="lightblue">This text will be highlighted in light blue.</p>
```

2. **Tooltip Directive**: This directive shows a tooltip when hovering over an element.

- Directive Class Name: RdxTooltipDirective
- Selector: [rdxTooltip]

```html
<button rdxTooltip="Click to submit">Submit</button>
```
